				<li>Each meal (not snacks) should  contain the right proportion of carbohydrate, protein and vegetables (see the <a href="http://www.nhs.uk/Livewell/Goodfood/Pages/eatwell-plate.aspx" title="Portion plate" target="_blank">recommended  meal portions</a>).</li>
				<li>Unless you are eating too big a  portion already, there is no need to eat less, just eat the right foods in the  right combination.&nbsp; If you eat a very  large portion every meal, make the largest part of the portion vegetables.</li>
				<li>Eat a lot of fruits (you should eat  5&ndash;a&ndash;day of fruits and vegetables at the minimum), but watch the fruit content  of your food.&nbsp; Fruits contain sugar and  if you eat too much of them, you may increase the calories you take in without  meaning to.</li>
				<li>Don&rsquo;t eat a big meal just before you  go to bed (for most of us, that will be late at night).&nbsp; My mentor is fond of saying: &ldquo;eat like a queen  in the morning, like a king in the afternoon and like a pauper in the  evening&rdquo;.&nbsp; She was right &ndash; it worked for  me.&nbsp; Your &lsquo;kingly feast&rsquo; should be when you  are most active to give you the opportunity to work it off during the day.</li>
				<li>Eat a portion of legumes at least 4  times per week (e.g. beans and lentils).</li>
				<li>Eat fish at least 2&ndash;4 times per week  (e.g. sardines, tuna, trout, yellow tail, mackerel or salmon).</li>
				<li>Have a strategy for handling what I call &lsquo;<strong>comfort eating</strong>&rsquo; times.  This is when I turn to food to cope with some stressful times or excitements going on around me.  The tendency is to reach for the high calorie food items like chocolates, ice creams, biscuits etc. Find something else that you can eat with low calorie content &ndash; mine is cashew nuts.  Because I loved it so much, it quickly replaced chocolates, biscuits and ice cream for me and I would sometimes find myself turning my craving for chocolates  to cashew nuts.  (You should still be careful about your nuts portions and any other low-calorie food item &ndash; they could increase your calorie intake if you have too much!)</li>
