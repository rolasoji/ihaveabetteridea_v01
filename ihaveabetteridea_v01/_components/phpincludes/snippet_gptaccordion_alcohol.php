			<p>Alcohol contains very high calories and it is not filling, so typically, it is consumed as an accompaniment to meals or as well as meals. Drunk within a social event, it is very easy to consume enough alcohol with as much calorie content as your daily (or even weekly) calorie allowance in one sitting. What&rsquo;s more ... and here comes the health warning: prolonged alcohol use can cause kidney and liver damage and are generally bad for you &ndash; I am sure you know that already, so enough said.</p>
			<p>Unless you are a teetotal however, it may be difficult (and unrealistic) to expect that you can avoid alcohol altogether during your diet programme. It is therefore best to plan for it in your diet or have it as an occassional treat.  The following guidelines may help:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Reduce  your daily intake to say 1 pint of lager or 1&ndash;2 glasses of wine as part of your daily calorie intake. Note that this may mean reducing your daily food portion a bit to make up for it if you drink alcohol daily. </li>
				<li>Be watchful of your alcohol intake at social events; try mixing it with real fruit juice to make it go longer if possible or allow yourself a little alcohol, but once you've consumed your daily intake, continue with lower calorie drinks.</li>
				<li>If you go over your daily / weekly allowance, be prepared to do some extra exercises (or spend more time in the gym) over the next few days to work it off, but don&rsquo;t make a habit of doing this &ndash; it is trying on the body.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>Finally, perhaps you&rsquo;ve heard that red wine is good for the heart and this may be true, but know that you can get the antioxidants you get from  red wine from other foods, such as fruits and vegetables (e.g. spinach) &ndash; much better for your body. Drinking alcohol for health reasons is really not a good idea because you may find yourself drinking more than you should. In most cases (if not all), whatever benefit you get from it can be obtained elsewhere in a more useful form. </p>
