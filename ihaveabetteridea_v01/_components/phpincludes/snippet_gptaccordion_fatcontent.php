			<p>There are 4  types of fats:</p>
			<p><strong>Monounsaturated (good):</strong> reduces cholesterol, tryglycerides &amp;  blood pressure and help control diabetes.&nbsp;  Usually found in olive oil, peanut oil, cashews, canola oil, hazelnuts,  peanuts, macadamia nuts, pistachios, pine nuts &amp; chicken fat.<br />
			<strong>Polyunsaturated (good):</strong> &nbsp;reduces tryglycerides, inflammations &amp;  tumour growth, improve immune function and help protect against sudden death  from heart disease.&nbsp; Can be broken down  into 2 &ndash; omega 3 &amp; 6.&nbsp; Omega 3 is  found in canola oil, walnuts, flax seeds, hempseeds, salmon, mackerel, trout,  tuna, sardines &amp; herring.&nbsp; Omega 6 is  found in safflower oil, sunflower oil, sesame oil, nuts, beans &amp; soft  margarine.<br />
			<strong>Saturated (bad):</strong> &nbsp;raises cholesterol, increase the risk of heart  disease and stroke.&nbsp; Found in meats,  whole milk, cheese, palm &amp; coconut oil.<br />
			<strong>Trans (bad):</strong> &nbsp;raises bad cholesterol: LDL, lowering good  cholesterol: HDL; increasing the risk of heart disease and stroke.&nbsp; Found in crackers, cookies, cakes,  shortening, margarine, hydrogenated oils &amp; vegetable oils that have been  subjected to heat&ndash;damage during cooking. </p>
			<p>Be careful  of the following foods as they contain lots of hidden fats: beef fillet, T&ndash;bone  steak, mince, sausage, pork sausages, pork, mutton, chicken with skin, deep  fried foods, processed meats, vienna sausages, salami, bacon, full cream and  medium fat cheeses. (A matchbox&ndash;sized block of Emmenthal cheese is the maximum  fat intake portion for the day!) </p>
			<p>Other foods  containing lots of fats are rusks, scones, cappuccino with cream, croissants,  cakes and pastries, tinned soup, small biscuits, mayonnaise, muffins, pies, pates,  creamy sauces, salad dressing, savoury biscuits, toffees, chocolates, ice  cream, nougat, quiches, savoury tarts. (1 slice of quiche has 30 grams of fat &ndash;  just as much as an ice cream on a stick or a meat pie).</p>
