			<ul>
				<li>Avoid &lsquo;quick-fix&rsquo; weight loss solutions like the plague &ndash; they have very short life-span and can leave a lasting damage to the body.</li>
				<li>Decide on a diet and exercise programme and make sure it is one that you will be able to continue even when the excess weight is off. The only difference in your programme once you&rsquo;ve reached your target weight should be perhaps the intensity and rate at which you exercise; and you may be able to have more of those very much loved treats that are so &lsquo;bad&rsquo; as long as it is under controlled conditions.</li>
				<li>Depending on how much weight you have to lose to get to your target weight, be prepared to stick to your diet and exercise programme over a lengthy period of time.  If you focus on the time period, chances are you&rsquo;ll be tempted to take &lsquo;short cuts&rsquo;.  Focus instead on your target weight and change your lifestyle to get yourself there.</li>
				<li>Set short-term achievable targets &ndash; no more than 4 weeks at a time and break that down into even shorter time periods (e.g. 5-7 days). For example, you could aim to lose 6 kgs (0.9 stone or 13.2 pounds) in 1 month or 4 weeks, and then work towards this target week by week.</li>
				<li>Keep records. This is very important and very motivating, especially when you meet your targets. It also helps you to reflect back and see where you might be going wrong when you haven&rsquo;t met your targets. You need to keep records of: 
					<ul>
						<li>daily food diary </li>
						<li>exercise programmes</li>
						<li>amount of weight lost from week to week. </li>
					</ul>
					<p>You can <a href="http://www.balancewellness.co.uk/blog/documents/food&exercise_template.xls" title="Record templates" target="_blank">download an Excel template</a> of the diaries I used but there are several diary templates online and great mobile phone apps (found <a href="http://www.myfitnesspal.com/mobile" title="MyFitnessPal mobile apps" target="_blank">MyFitnessPal app</a> especially useful for short-term weight loss plans &ndash; versions available for iPhone, android phones and Blackberry).</p>
