    <h2>Helpful tools</h2>
    <p>Here are some of the tools I've used in the past. While I found many of them invaluable and still do, note the ones listed below are in no way prescriptive. Ideally, you should try as many tools as you can find to find out what gets you the best results.</p>

            <h4>Food diary</h4>
            <p>Diaries are perhaps the most important tools you will need. You'd be amazed at how easy it is to forget how much calorie you've taken in from day to day. Diaries help you to identify strategies that will work for you long term and get rid of those bad habits. They also help motivate you, providing opportunities to reflect on the progress you've made over time. Regular periods of reflection is necessary to use them effectively.</p>
            <p>You should keep a record of your food intake (whenever you eat), exercise programmes (type, duration, calories lost etc.) and the amount of weight loss / gained (daily, if you can; otherwise, weekly). Better to record your weight at about the same time and / or after the same daily activities &ndash; found it works better for me early in the mornings.</p>

        <div role="tabpanel" class="tab-pane fade" id="pedometer">
            <h4>Pedometer</h4>
            <p>A pedometer counts the number of steps you take. They come in various forms and some can double up as a heart rate / activity monitor. Essentially, you need one that is accurate. I've used several but I am quite impressed with the Digiwalker CW700. It's a metal click on the back which is quite strong and a cover which prevents steps count from getting accidentally erased. It also has a 7-day memory. I also found the fitness features of the latest Apple iPod nano (released in 2005) brilliant. It's got a clip for attachment to clothing or bag and the pedometer is reasonably accurate. Aim to take an average of 10,000 &ndash; 15,000 steps each day and increase this as necessary if your pedometer is not accurate or as you become more fit. I found the pedometer very useful at motivating me to get enough exercise, setting myself maximum steps count to aim for each day.</p>

        <div role="tabpanel" class="tab-pane fade" id="gym">
            <h4>Gym membership</h4>
            <p>This will certainly help but if you can't afford one, don't worry. Although opinions are divided on the issue, several experts believe high intensity exercises doesn't really lose as much weight as the low-intensity ones. Take a look at the exercise suggestions for some examples of both high and low intensity exercises. There are also opportunities to join low cost aerobics class run by the local council &ndash; check if there are any in your area; or you could organise one in your front room using a good exercise video. Group exercise is motivating, but if you prefer, you can exercise on your own. Walking will also do you a world of good and add to those much needed steps count!</p>

        <div role="tabpanel" class="tab-pane fade" id="mentor">
            <h4></h4>
            <p>This can be very useful when you are just starting out, especially if you are a beginner. Fitness trainers can help keep you in line and teach you techniques that could be useful when you no longer need their services. If you can't afford one, it is a good idea to find someone that can act as a mentor for you and help motivate you. You should avoid choosing someone who is intimidated by you and they will need to know enough about keeping fit and losing weight to be able to advice you.</p>
