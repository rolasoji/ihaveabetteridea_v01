        <h3>What is wellness?</h3>
        <p>There is no consensus on a definition for wellness. Like most feelings, it is subjective; sometimes a state of mind and more about what makes you feel good.  In general and simple terms, wellness is a state of good health, high / fulfilled quality of life and general well-being.  Wellness can be defined in terms of your occupation, physical, intellectual, emotional, mental and spiritual well-being, finances, social links and medical health.  You won&rsquo;t feel a sense of well-being in all of these areas all the time but you should be able to bounce back quickly from the low or high points to an even &lsquo;well&rsquo; plane where you can have a positive quality of life.</p>

        <h3>Do I need to be physically fit to be well?</h3>
        <p>Physical fitness, regular exercise and a good diet have been identified as essential requirements for wellness.  In fact, many wellness definitions are stated in terms of fitness and if you are unfit, you are more than likely unhealthy in both body and spirit.  You do not have to participate in strenuous exercises or go to the gym to maintain your physical fitness.  Taking walks and seizing opportunities to move various parts of your body regularly can help you stay fit and healthy.</p>

        <h3>I am overweight but I don&rsquo;t feel unwell</h3>
        <p>It is important that you maintain your body weight and ensure you are not excessively overweight.  Weight has been proven to be a contributory factor or the main cause of several deceases including heart attack, diabetes and cancer.  If you do not feel unwell now, chances are you could feel unwell sooner or later.  Also, you will find that your weight limits you and reduces your quality of life in a variety of ways e.g. coping with day-to-day living and stress, no matter how sedentary your occupation / activities may be.  <strong>However, we suggest you seek medical advice before embarking on any weight management programme.</strong></p>
        <a name="faq4"></a>
        <h3>Can I maintain my wellness through healthy eating?</h3>
        <p>Yes!  Healthy eating combined with regular exercise is crucial to staying well.  Ensure your meal is balanced, containing all the food groups: carbohydrates, proteins, fruits and vegetables and the <em>right</em> type of fats (unsaturated fats) in the right proportions.  In general, your portion should be 1 part each of protein and carbohydrate to 2 parts vegetables; with fat limited to about the size of your thumb.  If you need to lose weight, you should make the carbohydrate content of your meals about half the size of the protein portion.  Fruits and vegetables should be double the portion of your protein foods (5 fruits and vegetables daily are recommended).  Although there are several tools on our websites that may help, you may find the <a href="http://www.nhs.uk/Livewell/Goodfood/Documents/Eatwellplate.pdf" target="_blank">eatwell plate</a> by NHS (National Health Service) UK helpful or download the <a href="http://www.bhf.org.uk/heart-health/prevention/healthy-eating.aspx" target="_blank">healthy eating guide</a> by BHF.

        <h3>I have food allergies.  How can I eat healthy?</h3>
        <p>It could be challenging to eat balanced meals when you have food allergies but it is not impossible.  There are usually healthy alternative options to any type of food.  Consult your medical doctor and / or find a dietician to help you plan your meals.
