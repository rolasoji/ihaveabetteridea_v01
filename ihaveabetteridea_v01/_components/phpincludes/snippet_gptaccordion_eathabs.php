				<li>You need to eat small meals more than 3 times per day to boost your <a href="http://www.balancewellness.co.uk/blog/metabolism" title="Basal metabollic rate (BMR)">basal metabolic rate (BMR)</a>.&nbsp; This is the rate at which your body use  energy while you are at rest (or asleep).&nbsp; Your BMR  slows down as you get older, but when you exercise and don&rsquo;t starve your body,  it speeds up, working harder.&nbsp; You  basically need your BMR at its optimal level while at rest, to use up the  calories you are taking in.</li>
				<li>Eating small amounts of healthy food every 3 hours or so is better than eating big meals 2 or 3 times each day.&nbsp; I generally eat 6 meals a day; 3 main meals (breakfast,  lunch and dinner) and 3 snacks (mid&ndash;morning, mid&ndash;afternoon and evening).</li>
				<li>You should eat a handful of nuts per  week (e.g. almonds, pecan, macadamia, cashew, pistachio, walnuts, peanuts and  peanut butter).  They are generally low in calories, but do be careful because too much of it will add more to your calorie intake.&nbsp;</li>
				<li>Give yourself treats, especially in the beginning.  Instead of giving up some food items completely, have it occasionally as treats (no more than once or twice a week &ndash; and watch those portions). For example, you should watch your sugar and fat intake as  much as possible, but if you like chocolates and sweets, having the occasional treat       will help keep you from overeating, as long as you watch the <a href="http://www.nhs.uk/Livewell/Goodfood/Pages/eatwell-plate.aspx" title="Portion plate" target="_blank">portions</a> (i.e. have a small bite size instead of a whole bar for example, or try the low sugar / fat options). It is a known fact that you crave something you can&rsquo;t have!</li>
				<li>Drink plenty of water and use it as a tool to keep your food intake down.  If you find you are hungry between meals, try drinking a glass of water or fruit juice first, and wait a bit. If you are still hungry, then eat a fruit, vegetable snack or nuts. Sometimes, you&rsquo;ll find that once you&rsquo;ve drank a glass of water, you are no longer hungry.</li>
