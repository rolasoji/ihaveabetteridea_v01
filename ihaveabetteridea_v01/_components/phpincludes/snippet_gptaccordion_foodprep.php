				<li>Rather than frying foods try grilling,  stewing, steaming, boiling, dry roasting, stir&ndash;frying, dry frying, micro waving  or baking in the oven, instead.</li>
				<li>If you use oils, use the ones that  contain more omega&ndash;3 fatty acids or mono&ndash;unsaturated fats (e.g. linseed oil,  canola, or olive oil).</li>
				<li>Avoid all animal fats, coconut, palm  kernel oil and margarine.</li>
				<li>Grill meat on a rack so that the fat  drips away.</li>
				<li>Try using non&ndash;stick cookware to  reduce the fat needed.</li>
				<li>Brown meat and mince without adding  fat or oil.</li>
				<li>If you have to use oil in cooking, measure  it into a spoon (rather than pouring it from the bottle) to help reduce the  amount that you use.</li>
				<li>Use reduced&ndash;fat and low&ndash;fat dairy  products (such as skimmed milk, semi&ndash;skimmed milk or reduced&ndash;fat cheese)  whenever possible.</li>
				<li>Choose a low&ndash;fat spread rather than  butter and use these sparingly.</li>
				<li>Salad dressings, mayonnaise, cream  and rich sauces are all high in fat so choose low fat versions.</li>
				<li>Choose lean meat and mince, trimming the  visible fat off the meat and the skin off chicken before cooking.</li>
				<li>Replace cream in recipes with low  fat natural yogurt or cream.</li>
				<li>Use less meat in casseroles and  stews and add beans, pulses or vegetables instead.</li>
				<li>Choose tomato or vegetable based  pasta sauces rather than cheesy or creamy ones.</li>
				<li>Try using spices, herbs, lemon juice,  vinegar, soy sauce, fresh chillies, fresh ginger or garlic which are low in fat  as a way of adding flavour to food.</li>
