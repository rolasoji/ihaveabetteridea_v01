				<li>Buy one or two clothing item(s) in the ideal size you want &ndash; something that you will want to wear to show off your new slim-lined shape. (This was really a motivating factor for me. I had a couple of items in my wardrobe that seemed to have taken root in there &ndash; they&rsquo;ve been there for that long! Periodically, I&rsquo;ll take them out to see if they fit  and when they didn&rsquo;t, it was a bit disappointing, but it also motivated me to keep going. When I was finally able to wear them, it was one of the greatest moment in my life!</li>
				<li>Find someone to help motivate  and keep you going when the will is flagging or join a weight loss club. Weight loss clubs didn&rsquo;t work for me because of work commitments, but mentoring did. Without my mentor to keep me going, especially at the beginning, I would have given up. Find someone that you cannot intimidate and will listen to; if you can afford a fitness trainer, even better. If your mentor is a friend / family, they will need to know what they are talking about, so choose wisely.&nbsp; Ultimately (and this is important), while you do need to listen to your mentor or trainer,  don&rsquo;t forget you are the best judge of what'll work best for you so you need to do some hard work too to find out what those are.</li>
				<li>Build a relationship with your mentor or trainer and test out the advices / suggestions given by them. My mentor was a medical nurse but even so, when she first started giving me  tips, I'll first give them a go and only follow them when they work. Once you've built up a relationship with your mentor or trainer, it'll be easier to trust their judgement.</li>
				<li><strong>Discipline and determination</strong> goes a long way! I can&rsquo;t really stress this enough because there will be many &lsquo;no one will know&rsquo; and &lsquo;I really can&rsquo;t take any more of this&rsquo; moments when all you&rsquo;ll have is your determination to get you through. I firmly believe  weight loss / fitness plans fail only because we don't really want them enough. That was definitely true in my case &ndash; it was the only thing that made a difference. If you want something badly enough, you will work hard for it! </li>
